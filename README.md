# Will I Last?

**A pace checker for your Claude weekly usage limits.**

Claude tells you *what %* you've used â€” but not whether you're burning too fast or have plenty of room. This tool answers the one question everyone asks mid-week: **"Will I last until reset?"**

## What It Does

1. You check your usage % in **Claude Settings â†’ Usage**
2. You type those numbers in here
3. It instantly tells you:
   - Whether you're **ahead or behind pace** compared to where you should be
   - Your **projected usage** by week's end at your current rate
   - Exactly how much **% per day** you can safely spend for the rest of the week

## Features

- Tracks both **All Models** and **Sonnet** limits separately
- Visual pace bars comparing your usage against elapsed time
- Daily budget calculator so you know exactly how much room you have
- Configurable reset day/time (defaults to Thursday 10 PM)
- Saves your settings and last-entered values between visits
- Works on desktop and mobile â€” add to home screen for app-like access
- **Zero tracking, zero data collection** â€” everything stays in your browser's localStorage

## How It Works

Claude's weekly limits reset on a fixed schedule (e.g., every Thursday at 10 PM). This tool calculates what percentage of your billing week has elapsed, then compares that against your actual usage percentage.

- Used **30%** with **50%** of the week gone? You're under budget.
- Used **50%** with **30%** of the week gone? You're burning too fast.

It's that simple â€” but doing this math manually every time is annoying. So now you don't have to.

## Usage

Visit **[dan0dandeleon11.github.io/will-i-last](https://dan0dandeleon11.github.io/will-i-last/)** â€” that's it. No install, no sign-up.

On mobile, tap **Share â†’ Add to Home Screen** for quick access.

## Why?

Because checking a datetime calculator for hours elapsed, then dividing by 168 on a separate calculator, then comparing against your usage %... is a terrible workflow. This does it in 2 seconds.
